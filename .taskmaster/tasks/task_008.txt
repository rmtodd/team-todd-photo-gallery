# Task ID: 8
# Title: Caching and Service Worker Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive service worker for offline capabilities, smart prefetching, and advanced caching strategies, along with full PWA functionality.
# Details:
1. PWA Configuration & Setup:
   - Configured Next.js with PWA capabilities using next-pwa package
   - Created comprehensive manifest.json with app metadata, icons, shortcuts, and screenshots
   - Added security headers for PWA including CSP, X-Frame-Options, and cache control
   - Configured iOS-specific PWA metadata and icons

2. Advanced Service Worker Implementation:
   - Built comprehensive sw.js with multiple caching strategies:
     - Cache First: For Cloudinary images and static assets (30-day expiration)
     - Stale While Revalidate: For API endpoints and dynamic content (1-day expiration)
     - Network First: For HTML pages with offline fallback
   - Created beautiful offline.html fallback page with auto-retry functionality
   - Implemented background sync for failed uploads when users come back online
   - Added push notification support with action buttons
   - Automatic cache cleanup and size monitoring

3. Smart Prefetching System:
   - Built SmartPrefetcher component with intelligent prefetching based on:
     - Current photo index with configurable radius
     - Intersection Observer for viewport-based prefetching
     - Network-aware prefetching (adjusts based on connection speed)
     - API data prefetching for next pages
   - Implemented performance optimization to prevent network overload

4. Service Worker Management:
   - Created ServiceWorkerManager component with:
     - Online/offline status indicators
     - Service worker update notifications with user-friendly UI
     - Cache size monitoring and management
     - Development tools for cache debugging
     - Automatic service worker registration and lifecycle management

5. Integration & User Experience:
   - Added smart prefetching to the PhotoGallery with 5-photo radius
   - Integrated ServiceWorkerManager into root layout
   - Enhanced metadata for better app installation experience
   - Created SVG-based icon system for PWA with camera/gallery theme

6. Caching Strategies Implementation:
   - Cloudinary Images: Cache-first with 30-day expiration, 200 max entries
   - API Responses: Stale-while-revalidate with 1-day expiration, 50 max entries
   - Static Assets: Cache-first with 30-day expiration, 100 max entries
   - Dynamic Pages: Network-first with offline fallback
   - Background Prefetching: Smart prefetching based on user behavior and network conditions

7. Offline Capabilities:
   - Implemented graceful degradation for offline functionality
   - Added clear visual feedback for offline status
   - Implemented automatic retry when connection is restored
   - Ensured previously viewed photos remain available offline

8. Performance Features:
   - Implemented network-aware adjustments for prefetching
   - Added automatic cache cleanup and size limits
   - Implemented non-blocking prefetching and caching
   - Ensured progressive enhancement for browsers without service worker support

# Test Strategy:
1. Test offline functionality by disabling network:
   - Verify cached images load when offline
   - Test offline fallback page
   - Ensure graceful degradation of features
2. Measure performance improvements with caching:
   - Compare load times with and without caching
   - Verify prefetching behavior under different network conditions
3. Test service worker update process:
   - Verify update notifications appear correctly
   - Ensure smooth transition between service worker versions
4. Validate PWA installation and functionality:
   - Test app installation process on various devices
   - Verify correct metadata, icons, and shortcuts
5. Test background sync and push notifications:
   - Verify failed uploads sync when coming back online
   - Test push notification delivery and action buttons
6. Evaluate smart prefetching system:
   - Verify correct prefetching based on user scrolling and network conditions
   - Test API data prefetching for next pages
7. Assess caching strategies:
   - Verify correct caching behavior for different asset types
   - Test cache size limits and automatic cleanup
8. Cross-browser and cross-device testing:
   - Ensure consistent behavior across major browsers and devices
   - Test progressive enhancement on browsers without service worker support
